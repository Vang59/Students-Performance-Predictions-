## Overview of the Analysis
Using machine learning, we aim to analyze the various factors that can impact a high school student's academic performance. Our objective is to determine if there is a correlation between a student's circumstances and their overall performance on math, reading, and writing exams. Subsequently, we plan to develop a machine learning model that can predict a student's performance based on these features.

## Summary

* It is our conclusion that certain conditions do in fact impact a student's academic performance when it comes to exam scores. 
    * Gender: Female students have higher average exam scores in Reading and Writing however, Male students have higher average exam scores in Math.
    * Race/Ethnicity: Students belonging to the E group for race and ethnicity consistently have higher average scores in all subjects.
    * Parental Level of Education: Students with parents who completed only some high school consistently have lower average exam scores in all subjects.
    * Lunch Type: Students with standard lunch fees significantly scored more A letter grade exam scores in Math, Reading, and Writing versus those who receive free/reduced lunch.
    * Test Preparation Course: Students who completed a test preparation course consistently have the least failing exam scores and more A letter grade exam scores in all 3 academic subjects. 
* In summary, female students who belong to the E race group with parents who have some sort of college degree, have standard lunch fees, and complete a test preparation course are the students who can be predicted to be the higher performing students when it comes to Math, Reading, and Writing exam scores. 
* Conversely, male students who belong to the B race group with parents who only completed some high school, have free/reduced lunch, and do not complete a test preparation course are the students who can predicted to be the lower performing students when ti comes to Math, Reading, and Writing exam scores.
