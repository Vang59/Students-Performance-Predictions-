## Overiew of the Analysis
Using machine learning, we aim to analyze the various factors that can impact a high school student's academic performance. Our objective is to determine if there is a correlation between a student's circumstances and their overall performance on math, reading, and writing exams. Subsequently, we plan to develop a machine learning model that can predict a student's performance based on these features.
